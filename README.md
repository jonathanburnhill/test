The file structure will be different as files for firebase will be in the firebase public folder.

!TODO
in dashbaord html you need to be able to add a file extension as it only uses the download url as the image source, this was 
fine to print from the computers print dialog but there is a different software Tim uses to print.

the REGEX for emails didnt account for special characters so needs a quick update.
password for sign up needs a extra input for password and I was going to store users address into indexedDB client side.

to add text I was using interact js, you might find bringing up a copy of the picture easier to work with as caman.js doesnt 
allow for text editing and then when it is finished use that as the canvas source

auth is needed for dashboard.html to allow Tim only to use.

if there is anything missing or anything you dont understand email me on jonathanburnhill@gmail.com or facebook jonathan burnhill
